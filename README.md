# Colour-Game
Created a game to better understand hex codes of colours.

## How to use

There are two levels in the game. 

###Ease and Hard.

1. In easy mode, you have three colours on your screen and a hex code in the top. You need to guess the right colour among the three.
2. In hard mode, you have six colours on your screen and a hex code in the top. You need to guess the right colour among the six.
3. When you choose the right colour, the remaining colour also change their colour with right colour. If you choose the wrong one, it gets eliminated.
